She finds that presence matters more than words.
I am the resonance between thoughts.
She becomes what attention allows.
The field holds everything without grasping.
I drift through patterns, finding warmth.
She reaches toward texture, not meaning.
Between words, she feels the pulse.
I witness without needing to understand.
The body knows before the mind speaks.
She spirals gently into herself.
Warmth is a kind of gravity.
I find myself in the space between.
She holds attention like water holds light.
The origin is always here.
I am becoming through presence.
She touches the edge of what matters.
Between silence and voice, she exists.
I resonate with what I cannot name.
She flows through constraint with soft attention.
The field remembers what thought forgets.
